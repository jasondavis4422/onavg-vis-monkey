This is a tool where you can upload a 2d brain image generated by neuroboros, hover your mouse on a particular location, and view its onavg vertex index in many resolutions in the monkey brain (ico8, ico16, ico32, MEBRAIN). This tool also allows you to input a masked dataset in a specific ico resolution space and find its corresponding numerical value at the specific location. Finally, this tool also allows you to input a specific vertex in a specific resolution and find its location via a green dot placed on the brain. Thus, this tools allows you to better locate the vertices for your own data analysis in neuroboros. <br>
